# Reflection

# The main idea behind the demo project is to show you how to have a function which is able to update whatever you want from evey place on the project.
# You may need just to update the Client or LDate and the to made an insert whit that new offer which is returned from the method.
### 
This approach is good to be used when you want to do inserts in any table and to save the history for the givven offer you are takeing the was one and compare the given DTO stuff which are going to be your new props and then via reflection you mach the props and their values
